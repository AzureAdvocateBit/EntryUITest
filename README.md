# Entry UI Test Sample App

This app shows how to implement UITest in a Xamarin.Forms project.

We've added an AutomationId to each control to show how UITest can interact with controls using their AutomationId.

### C#7
The master branch contains features from C#7.0. If your IDE does not support C#7.0, you can use [this branch](https://github.com/brminnick/EntryUITest/tree/Remove-C%237), which does not contain C#7.0 features.
